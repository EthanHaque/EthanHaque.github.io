                    Equity is central to the City of Garlicfeldâ€™s mission and core values. Equity across all citizens is essential to providing exceptional public services and creating an inclusive, safe living environment for everyone. While equity is the pursuit of equality,
                    we strive to advance the notion of equity in Garlicfeld by identifying apparent social and economic disparities. We try to amplify the presence of equity by acknowledging those who have historically been left out of our decision-making
                    processes and by removing barriers to close the gap and achieve equality. We acknowledge that structural and cultural barriers impact access to, and representation in, the city of Garlicfeld. Without an intentional focus on equity,
                    we will continue to feed the flame of pertinent inequity in our society. We will ensure that all citizens of Garlicfeld experience the same access to resources, materials, and opportunities that will sprout senses of belonging, prosperity,
                    and happiness regardless of race, ethnicity, sex, gender, ability, social standing, or any other individualistic descriptors.

                            the software automatically determines which containers need service each day, then schedules routes and evenly distributes jobs to drivers.

                        <p>Hydroponics is able to grow sustainable food to feed expanding growing communities easily. In a large urban area like Garlicfeld, it is challenging to locally grow food, which produces fewer greenhouse gases than buying conventionally
                            sourced food. Therefore, growing food indoors in buildings or on rooftops presents an efficient use of space and effort. Hydroponics works by having plants grow upon a medium of minerals and water, which provides the nutrients
                            they need while requiring much less water waste than normal conventional agriculture. In addition, much less space is required to grow the same amount of produce. Thus it is far more efficient and wastes much fewer resources.
                            Managing a garden is tax-deductible in Garlicfeld.
