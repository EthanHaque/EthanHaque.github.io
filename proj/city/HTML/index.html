                <p>We believe that the only way to truly make progress is through commitment. That is why we are committed to a sustainable future and to improving the social, economic, and environmental well-being of the global community.</p>

                    Equity is central to the City of Garlicfeld’s mission and core values. Equity across all citizens is essential to providing exceptional public services and creating an inclusive, safe living environment for everyone. While equity is the pursuit of equality,
                    we strive to advance the notion of equity in Garlicfeld by identifying apparent social and economic disparities. We try to amplify the presence of equity by acknowledging those who have historically been left out of our decision-making
                    processes and by removing barriers to close the gap and achieve equality. We acknowledge that structural and cultural barriers impact access to, and representation in, the city of Garlicfeld. Without an intentional focus on equity,
                    we will continue to feed the flame of pertinent inequity in our society. We will ensure that all citizens of Garlicfeld experience the same access to resources, materials, and opportunities that will sprout senses of belonging, prosperity,
                    and happiness regardless of race, ethnicity, sex, gender, ability, social standing, or any other individualistic descriptors.

                            gets picked up and put down. This smart waste technology system allows roll-off haulers to manage container inventory, build better routes, and even accept orders through automated text messages. And for front-load haulers,
                            the software automatically determines which containers need service each day, then schedules routes and evenly distributes jobs to drivers.

                        <p>By using hydroponics, we are able to grow sustainable food to feed our expanding and growing communities easily. In a large urban area like Garlicfeld, it is challenging to locally grow food, which produces fewer greenhouse gases
                            than buying conventionally sourced food. Therefore, growing food indoors in buildings or on rooftops presents an efficient use of space and effort. Hydroponics works by having plants grow upon a medium of minerals and water,
                            which provides the nutrients they need while requiring much less water waste than normal conventional agriculture. In addition, much less space is required to grow the same amount of produce. Thus it is far more efficient and
                            wastes much fewer resources. <strong>Managing a garden is tax-deductible in Garlicfeld.</strong>

                        <p>
                            Solar power is the primary source of energy. Our implementation uses a hexahedral-shaped “dome” that gathers the Sun’s rays. These rays are converted to electricity and are stored in a long-term battery unit below the dome. There is a large-scale Power
                            Distribution Module (PDM) that sends power to different places throughout the city. Each dome costs roughly 2.2 million dollars, however, this system is highly efficient and can supply clean energy to all places in our city.
                            Per kilowatt hour, solar costs <strong>$0.029</strong> while traditional fossil fuels cost around <strong>$0.050</strong>, which makes this investment worth it in the long run.
